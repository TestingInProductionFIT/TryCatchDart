## Part 1 — Multi-Agent Coordination

> **Read this first. It prevents agents from stepping on each other.**

### 1.1 Ownership map

Each agent working in parallel must claim an area and stay inside it.
Cross-area changes require explicit coordination (see §1.4).

| Area | Canonical paths | Pinning tests |
|---|---|---|
| **Wire / codec** | `packages/serial/lib/telemetry/`, `packages/serial/lib/io/` | `frame_codec_test`, `packet_parser_test`, `recorder_test`, `recording_header_test`, `file_parser_test` |
| **Dead reckoning** | `packages/dead_reckoning/`, `lib/state/dead_reckoning_tune_store.dart`, `lib/ui/screens/dead_reckoning_lab_tab.dart` | package `dead_reckoning_test` (50), `dead_reckoning_tune_store_test`, `dead_reckoning_lab_tab_test`, `elevation_service_test` |
| **Core logic** | `lib/core/` | `ring_buffer_test`, `packet_rate_tracker_test`, `flight_events_test`, `highlights_test` |
| **State / providers** | `lib/state/` | `workspace_test`, `workspace_reorder_test`, `replay_seek_test`, `display_smoothing_test`, `replay_launch_site_test`, `launch_site_flow_test` |
| **Replay** | `lib/state/replay_controller.dart`, `lib/state/telemetry_store.dart` (replay paths) | `replay_seek_test`, `display_smoothing_test`, `mock_bq_test`, `flight_simulator_test` |
| **Map tile** | `lib/ui/tiles/map_tile.dart`, `lib/ui/tiles/shared/tile_io.dart`, `lib/ui/tiles/shared/offline_fallback_tiles.dart` | `map_track_test`, `map_tiles_test`, `map_follow_regression_test` |
| **3D / satellite tile** | `lib/ui/tiles/flight_3d_*.dart`, `lib/ui/tiles/shared/flight_3d_*`, `lib/ui/tiles/shared/satellite_ground.dart` | `flight_3d_scene_test`, `rocket_mesh_test`, `rocket_centering_test`, `sat_render_test`, `satellite_ground_test` |
| **Charts / tiles** | `lib/ui/tiles/` (non-3D, non-map) | `chart_touch_test`, `time_series_decimation_test`, `scroll_zoom_test`, `dead_reckoning_tile_test`, `events_tile_test`, `trim_chart_test` |
| **UI chrome** | `lib/ui/screens/`, `lib/ui/components/` | `top_bar_theme_test`, `brand_mark_theme_test`, `brand_navigates_home_test`, `link_stats_button_test`, `serial_controls_overflow_test`, `channel_health_test`, `channel_health_edit_mode_test`, `grid_render_test`, `tab_tooltip_semantics_test`, `flight_trim_test` |
| **Theme** | `lib/theme/` | `top_bar_theme_test`, `brand_mark_theme_test` |
| **Linux native shell** | `linux/runner/`, `linux/CMakeLists.txt`, `packaging/linux/` | (manual) |

**Shared / dangerous files — coordinate before touching:**
- `pubspec.yaml` / `pubspec.lock` — dep changes affect everyone; agree first.
- `lib/state/telemetry_store.dart` — touched by Wire, Core, State, and Replay agents.
- `packages/dead_reckoning/` — estimator/tune/eval/geo API; renames ripple into every tile + test that touches positions.
- `lib/ui/tiles/shared/flight_3d_scene.dart` — used by both 3D tile and rocket mesh work.
- `packages/serial/lib/telemetry/frame_codec.dart` — single wire format; any change invalidates recordings.
- `analysis_options.yaml` — changing lint rules can fail the whole tree for other agents.

### 1.2 Before you start a task

1. **Read this file.** Skim sections relevant to your area.
2. **Check git status.** `git status` — the working tree must be clean.
   If there are uncommitted changes from a previous agent, **do not stash them blindly**.
   Read what they are. If they are in your area, commit or discard them with justification.
   If they are in another area, stop and report — do not absorb foreign work.
3. **Run the baseline.**
   ```powershell
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```
   Record the number of passing tests. If the baseline is already red, **stop and report** — do not start work on a broken tree. You are not responsible for failures you did not introduce.
4. **Claim your area** — note in your task description which ownership-map area you are in.
5. **Create a branch** (optional but strongly recommended for anything beyond a one-file fix):
   ```powershell
   git switch -c agent/<area>/<short-description>
   ```

### 1.3 While you work

- **Stay in your area.** If you discover a bug outside your area that blocks you, open a note in the session log (Part 8) and ask for a separate agent to fix it.
- **Do not use `git stash`** to hide work. Stashed changes are invisible to other agents and can be overwritten silently. Commit with a clear WIP message instead, or discard explicitly.
- **Commit small and often.** One logical change per commit. This makes rebasing and conflict resolution tractable.
- **Do not run the app.** The app requires hardware or a mock port and a desktop session. Ask the user for screenshots/descriptions instead. Run `flutter test` and `flutter analyze` to verify.
- **Do not modify tests that were green before you started**, unless the test itself is what you were asked to fix. If a previously-green test now fails, see §1.5.

### 1.4 Cross-area changes

If your task genuinely requires touching another agent's area:

1. **Stop.** Do not proceed unilaterally.
2. **Document** what you need changed and why (in the session log Part 8 or a comment).
3. **Coordinate** — either the other agent makes the change, or you explicitly take over that area for this task (acknowledge the full area's pinning tests).
4. **Run the full pinning test suite** for every area you touched before handing off.

### 1.5 If a test you didn't touch is failing

> This is the most common source of confusion in parallel work.

**Triage checklist — run in order, stop when you find the cause:**

1. **Was it failing before you started?** Re-check the baseline you recorded in §1.2 step 3. If yes, it is not your fault — report it and move on.
2. **Did you touch a shared file?** (see §1.1 shared/dangerous list). Even a formatting change in `telemetry_store.dart` can affect tests in multiple areas.
3. **Is the failure in a test that pins a contract your code must satisfy?** e.g., if you changed the wire format, `frame_codec_test` will fail — that is expected and you own the fix.
4. **Is the failure transient?** Some widget tests are timing-sensitive. Run `flutter test <test_file>` in isolation before blaming your change.
5. **Is the failure in a FS-backed screen test?** `path_provider` and `Directory.list` stall permanently inside the fake-async zone (widget tests). These tests cannot be written as widget tests — that is a known Flutter limitation, not a bug in your code.
6. If none of the above apply: **do not touch the failing test**. Write a clear note in Part 8, commit your work, and hand off.

### 1.6 Before you hand off / finish

1. **`flutter analyze`** must be clean (zero issues).
2. **`flutter test`** must be green. The count must be ≥ the baseline you recorded. If you added tests, the count should be higher.
3. **Update Part 8 (session log)** with a concise entry: what changed, which tests were added/changed, the new passing count.
4. **Update the relevant technical section** (Parts 2–7) if you changed anything architectural.
5. Commit everything with a clear message. No WIP commits in a finished handoff.
6. If you branched, do not merge — leave the branch and note it in Part 8. The user decides when to merge.

---

## Part 2 — Stack & Conventions

### 2.1 Toolchain

- Flutter SDK ^3.13, installed at `C:\Users\wwwho\flutter`. Desktop shells for Windows, Linux, macOS.
- Always run with `--release` for evaluation — debug builds are janky and misrepresent performance.
- `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` are the only CI gates. Both must be green before any handoff.
- Current passing test count: **400** (350 root `flutter test` + 50 `packages/dead_reckoning` `dart test` — update this when you finish).

### 2.2 Dependencies (key constraints)

| Package | Version | Gotchas |
|---|---|---|
| Riverpod | 3, no codegen | `Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier`. Use `AsyncValue.value`, **not** `valueOrNull`. `ProviderScope.overrides` injects the worker isolate in `main`. |
| fl_chart | 1.2 | `SideTitleWidget(meta: meta, child:)`, `LineChart(duration: Duration.zero)`, `StrokePattern.dashed`, `BarAreaData`. `BorderSide.strokeAlignInside` is a `double`, not an enum. |
| flutter_map | 8.3 | + `latlong2`, `vector_math` (`transformed(Vector4)`, `transformed3(Vector3)`, `scaleByDouble(x,y,z,w)`). |
| tray_manager | 0.7.0 | Linux: still calls deprecated `app_indicator_new()`. `linux/CMakeLists.txt` suppresses `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` on the plugin target only (guarded by `if(TARGET …)`). Our own code keeps `-Werror`. |
| Others | — | `shared_preferences`, `path_provider`, `window_manager`, `flutter_libserialport`, local `packages/serial`. |

No router package (4 flat screens via enum provider). No `build_runner`/freezed.

### 2.3 Dark-mode const rule ⚠️

`AppColors` / `AppText.microLabel` / `AppText.monoValue` are **getters** that resolve the active palette at call time. **Never** hold them in a `const`, and **never** `const`-instantiate any widget that transitively reads them. `const AppShell` / `const TopBar` / `const`-screens froze whole subtrees across dark/light flips. Map tiles stay light in both modes.

### 2.4 Impeller / Windows-ARM64 blank-paint bug ⚠️

Per-card `BoxShadow` + `Clip.antiAlias` on grid tiles silently blanks the workspace grid — layout is correct, no exceptions thrown. Rules:
- `AppCard` has **no `boxShadow`** and uses `Clip.hardEdge`.
- Do not reintroduce either on grid tiles without testing on-device.
- Grid keeps dividers as invisible `Positioned` children in live mode so the Stack child count is identical in both edit and live modes.
- Nuclear fallback: `flutter::ImpellerSwitch::Disabled` in `windows/runner/flutter_window.cpp`.
- `Canvas.transform` perspective drapes also silently paint nothing on Impeller/OpenGLES — use the custom clip-space projection in the satellite tile instead.

### 2.5 Pointer input (desktop)

A precision-touchpad two-finger swipe arrives as `PointerPanZoom` events, **not** wheel scrolls. `flutter_map` ignores those for zoom; drag recognizers also ignore pure swipes. Every map/3D view must handle both paths:
- Wheel: `scrollWheelZoom` flag / `Listener.onPointerSignal`
- Trackpad swipe: explicit `onPointerPanZoomUpdate` handler

Map zooms with the wheel velocity, cursor-anchored via `focusedZoomCenter`, skipping updates that carry scale (flutter_map's pinch-zoom owns those). 3D shell + rocket tile zoom from swipe (`scrollZoomFactor`, ×1.1 per 120 units) and pinch, suppress drag-orbit while a trackpad gesture is active (a real press clears the flag). Pinned by `scroll_zoom_test.dart`.

### 2.6 Accessibility / AXTree

Windows desktop semantics are always on. Display-only readouts that repaint at telemetry rate must carry `ExcludeSemantics` to prevent AXTree spam. Policy:
- **ExcludeSemantics**: live text readouts inside `CenteredValue`, `ChartValueHeader`, `TimeSeriesChart`, channel charts, 3D readout, packet-rate + rec-timer + playhead clocks, battery discharge line, map legend/attribution.
- **Full semantics**: all interactive controls (buttons, chips, sliders, dropdowns, menus, fields, copy buttons).
- Adjacent bare tooltip anchors in one scrollable item merge in the AXTree (flutter/flutter#182444). Fix: `Semantics(container: true)` per anchor. Already applied to FSM/control grids. Every other list tooltip is button/InkWell-backed (own node) or single-per-item.

### 2.7 Theme

`lib/theme/`: white/dark cards (radius 12/8) on cool grey, hairline borders, monospace micro-labels (Consolas via `AppText`), team pink `#FF00A1` as the single accent (`pinkDeep` for text-safe accents; status stays green/amber/red). `AppCard` header = pink dot + mono uppercase label + hairline divider (**no tinted band**). `StatusPill` = mono uppercase stadium. Series colors: baro alt = pink, GPS/horiz = blue, dead reckoning/battery = violet, vert = green, accel = amber. Default system font (user declined bundling Inter).

### 2.8 Linux native shell

`linux/runner/my_application.cc`: `GtkHeaderBar` only on GNOME-like desktops (env `*DESKTOP*` has gnome/unity/pantheon/budgie, or X11 WM is GNOME Shell/Mutter); KDE Plasma and all other WMs fall back to a traditional title bar. Native title is `TryCatch`. X11 window icon resolves `linux/assets/icon.png` (dev) then `assets/icon.png` (bundle). On Wayland the icon comes from the hicolor theme via the `.desktop` entry (full 16–512 px set in `packaging/linux/icons/hicolor/*/apps/com.krychlic.trycatch.png`). `StartupWMClass=com.krychlic.trycatch` must equal the Wayland app_id. For `flutter run`, run `tool/install-linux-desktop-entry.sh` first.

---

## Part 3 — Wire Format & Serial Package

`packages/serial/` — single wire format, no versioning. Changing it invalidates all existing recordings and must be coordinated across Wire, State, and Replay agents.

### 3.1 Frame format

Framing: sync `0xAA55` + payload 52 bytes (incl. trailing CRC16). `telemetry/frame_codec.dart` `TelemetryLayout`, big-endian:

```
0  flags u8 (bit0 gpsFix, bit1 gpsFix3d)
1  seq u16              3  gpsLat i32 1e-7deg     7  gpsLon i32 1e-7deg
11 gpsAlt i32 cm        15 baroAlt i32 cm       19 velN i16 cm/s   21 velE   23 velD
25 accelX/Y/Z i16 mg    31 gyroX/Y/Z i16 centidps (±327 dps)
37 heading u16 centideg 39 roll i16 centideg 41 pitch 43 yaw
45 battery u16 mV       47 hall u16 raw (~2500 intact / ~2950 broken)
49 fsmState u8          50 crc16-ccitt (init 0xFFFF, poly 0x1021)
```

Units: WGS84 deg, metres, NED velocity (Down+), body-frame specific force (+9.81 at rest), gyro deg/s, rocket-oriented attitude (pitch = tilt from vertical, yaw = compass heading, roll = spin). CRC check vector `"123456789"` → `0x29B1`. `PacketParser` has fixed framing.

### 3.2 FSM states & airframe flags

`FsmState` ids: idle 0, armed 1, ascent 2, apogee 3, parachute 4, landed 5, debug-unlocked 6, debug-locked 7, unknown 255.

Airframe flags (derived from FSM state):
- `hasNosecone`: true on idle/armed/ascent/debug-locked (nose-cone tile LOCKED green), false on apogee/parachute/landed/debug-unlocked (UNLOCKED red).
- `hasParachute`: deployed on parachute + landed (retained from the previous parachute state).
- `showsParachute`: renders the canopy on parachute only.

### 3.3 Recording file format

`io/recording_file.dart`: 136-byte v2 header + telemetry chunk stream + command log. Header (big-endian): magic `TCR2` u32, payloadLength u16 (=52), flags u16, start/end micros i64, packetCount u64, max baro/speed/accel f32, launch lat/lon i32 1e-7deg, launch MSL f32, launch name 48 B UTF-8 NUL-padded, CRC16 over bytes 0..103, reserved, then a section directory (headerLength=136, version=2, telemetryByteLen u64, commandsOffset u64, commandCount u32, directory CRC over bytes 108..131). Command log: fixed 16-byte records (i64 tsUs + 4 raw uplink bytes + status + source). v1 `TCRC` files are rejected — convert with `dart run tool/migrate_recordings.dart`.

**Launch site is mandatory.** `start()` requires a site (provisional header already carries it, so even crash-interrupted files are valid). `stop()` finalizes via `finalizeRecordingFile` (never throws; idempotent). No first-GPS-fix fallback — siteless files are rejected everywhere. Magic-less files are rejected. Chunks carry a 12-byte header (i64 µs + u32 len).

> ⚠️ `crc_real_flight.bin` on disk is stale (pre-dates de-versioning). Re-convert from `flight_data.js` before use.

### 3.4 Mock simulator

`FlightSimulator` (seeded): coldStart 2 s → pad 6 s (armed after 2 s) → boost 2.8 s @55 m/s² → coast (drag 4e-4) → apogee ~1058 m + hall break → drogue (~40 m/s) → main @150 m (~6 m/s) → landed (pitch 85°). GPS random-walk, eastward wind drift, battery 8.4 V −2.5 mV/s. Prague pad.

`MockSerialPort` (`MOCK`): 10 Hz + 20 s interference cycle (12 s clean / 4 s light / 4 s heavy + bit-flipped clones) — sweeps all channel-health verdicts.

`MockBqSerialPort` (`MOCK-BQ`): same flight + interference, drops link completely for ~5 s every ~15 s — exercises dead reckoning gap filling and stale-link UI.

Worker isolate: typed commands (Connect/Disconnect/ListPorts/StartRecording/StopRecording/SendBytes) and events (Packet/PortList/Status/Error) over `SendPort`.

```

### 4.1 TelemetryStore

Decode, dead reckoning estimator (`packages/dead_reckoning`), ring buffers (9000 ≈ 15 min @10 Hz), auto-reset on port change, skips live ingestion while replaying, 80 ms throttle. `history`/`deadReckoningHistory` are zero-copy live views. Dead reckoning is a live-only gap filler: points enter history while GPS is silent ≥1 s; a 100 ms timer extrapolates through total link loss (live only). `deadReckoningStaleMs` (1000) is the shared stale threshold. Tuning arrives via `setDeadReckoningTune()` (in-memory; lab + persistence are a follow-up).

Persisted keys (`services/prefs_keys.dart`, no version suffixes): `trycatch.workspaces`, `trycatch.launch_sites`, `trycatch.dark_mode`.

### 4.2 Known weak points (out of scope — do not fix without a dedicated task)

- `AppThemeMode` singleton lives outside Riverpod.
- `ref.listen` in `build` (channel tile/pill, packet-rate tracker).
- `ref.read(workspaceProvider).value` staleness in some places.
- `TelemetryStore` is a god-store with bidirectional `ReplayController` coupling (sync `seek()` janks large files).
- Global orbit camera shared across 3D tiles.
- `SerialConfigNotifier` mixes UI/IO/FS concerns.

## Part 5 — Workspace Layout (KD-tree)

`SplitNode{id (stable), vertical, ratio, a, b}` | `LeafNode{tileId, tileType}`. Every tile type has a pixel min size; `layoutTree()` clamps splits to minimums.

Pure ops: `insertLeaf` (splits largest leaf, orientation from last-known shape), `removeLeaf`, `swapLeaves`, `treeFromOrder` (factory default), `SplitNode.flipOrientation` (double-click a divider in edit mode).

JSON: `{type:'split',id,vertical,ratio,a,b}` / `{type:'leaf',tileId,tileType}`.

Controller: addTile/removeTile/swapTiles/setRatio/setActive/create/duplicate/rename/delete/resetToDefaults/persistActive. Drags mutate with `persist:false`, persist on release. Grid memoizes layout by root identity + size.

Edit mode: dividers draggable, drag-to-swap, per-tile split/remove, tile content in `AbsorbPointer`. Dashboard: tabs (Ctrl+1..9, right-click menu, tooltips), Edit layout toggle, Add-tile picker, Reset with confirm.

Tile registry is data-driven — new tile = one class + one descriptor entry (id, title, description, minSize, immersive, builder).

---

## Part 6 — Tiles Reference

### 6.1 Shared pieces

- **`TimeSeriesChart`**: raw data, no smoothing. 60 s rolling window live; replay shows whole flight (played full opacity + remainder 25%). 1-2-5 y steps with zero baseline. Flat data opens the axis (was the `horizontalInterval = 0` crash). Decimation ≤400 pts by absolute packet time. Legend collapses under ~120 px tile height.
- **`ChartValueHeader`**: big readout for battery/hall.
- **`CenteredValue`**: centred headline + sublabel. Pins a tight `LayoutBuilder` box so `FittedBox` actually shrinks.
- **`Flight3dShell`**: camera-state mixin + gesture canvas / tool column / readout.
- **`tile_io.dart`**: Esri URLs, download, image check, shared disk cache.

### 6.2 Charts

Thin wrappers over `TimeSeriesChart`: altitude, velocity (horiz/vert-dashed/total), acceleration (vert-dashed/total), battery (+discharge rate line, hidden when short), hall (no legend, threshold 2700 colors the readout).

### 6.3 Non-chart info tiles

- **FSM**: big state + time-in-state (1 s ticker; replay uses playhead). Progress bar + pipeline/debug chip grids. Two-click send mirrors the control panel.
- **Max alt**: peak + NOW.
- **Nose cone** (`nosecone`): padlock icon + LOCKED (green) / UNLOCKED (red) from `hasNosecone`.
- **GPS position** (`stats`): large coordinates, one `·`-joined line (altitude + drift), fix-status footer, copy + QR-code actions.
- **Dead reckoning** (`dead_reckoning`, live only): link-healthy placeholder while packets flow; shows extrapolated coordinates on packet loss. Disabled during replay. Both share `PositionReadout`.
- **Highlights** (`highlights`): session extremes — max ascent/descent velocity, top speed (Mach), max acceleration (G). Replay-only third row: total drift + max altitude. Pinned by `highlights_test.dart`.
- **Events** (`events`): newest-first log. Live rows read "Launch — 12 s ago" (1 s ticker). Replay rows read "Launch — at 1:23" and tap to seek; future events dimmed.
- **Control panel**: `RocketCommands` catalog — bytes are **MADE-UP and must be aligned with real firmware before flight**. Two-click confirm (3 s). Disabled while disconnected or replaying.

### 6.4 Map tile

Immersive. Esri street / satellite (overzoom past 18). 1 GB disk cache. Precache zooms 13–17 ~1 km around saved sites. GPS solid blue vs per-gap dashed violet dead reckoning. Follow/satellite/zoom ToolFabs. `TileDisplay.instantaneous()` on both tile layers. Per-layer background colors (`satelliteMapBackground` near-black, `streetMapBackground` pale paper). Cropped fallback tiles memoized in 128-entry LRU `CroppedTileCache`.

### 6.5 3D tiles

All immersive. Metric scene east/up/south metres, origin = site or first fix. GPS trail only, dead reckoning as single violet point. Drop line, 1-2-5 ground grid with N/E labels. N/E/U compass. Chase/orbit-field/launch-pad/free cameras (80° cap). Wheel zoom, double-tap reset. World frame X east / Y up / Z south (right-handed; locked by `flight_3d_scene_test.dart`).

Satellite tile drapes Esri imagery as a screen-space mesh (one node per ~21 px ray-cast; parent-tile fallback; ≥5 km²; failures uncached + 15 s backoff) with procedural sky. **Never** `Canvas.transform` perspective drape — silently paints nothing on Impeller/OpenGLES.

**Performance** (`_paintMeshTier`): indexed drawing (up to 5× fewer vertex submissions), sub-pixel pad tier culling, quad-level frustum culling, static `Float32List` scratch buffers, inlined color caching, lazy `meshUvs`. 60-frame benchmark: 3,489 ms → 1,219 ms (median 57.7 → 20.2 ms).

**Perspective distortion**: adaptive 4D clip-space sub-tessellation in `emitTri` when `w_max > w_min * 1.5`. Mean error: 3.012 → 1.308.

**Depth ordering**: view-dependent far-to-near traversal (`terrainTierDrawOrder`). Pinned by `satellite_ground_test.dart` + `sat_render_test.dart`.

### 6.6 Top bar

Fixed-width skeleton (nothing shifts in any state). Slots: brand · link group (port dropdown incl. Rescan + Connect, link-stats button) · hairline · launch-site button · session (Record) · menu.

Link-stats button: left half = live pkt/s decaying to "N s ago" past 2 s liveness window; right half = unknown B/s. Color = max(packet severity, congestion severity). No packets within 2 s → red. Neutral only before any data ever arrived.

Launch-site button (flag + site name, amber SET SITE when unset): preset list (tap selects), manual entry, save-current-rocket-position. A site is always selected — no Clear; deleting active preset falls through. Record stays disabled until a site is set. Reset is in the menu (confirm dialog, disabled without data or during replay).

Replay: REPLAY badge + filename + play + time + flexible slider + speed popup + Back to live.

### 6.7 Channel health

Verdicts on unknown B/s: clear <50, activity <400, else interference. Dashboard tile = compact verdict row + rolling/replay chart (the only channel-health surface — the old Monitor screen is deleted, `ChannelHealthMonitor` with it; the tile keeps `ChannelHealthTile` + shared `_RateChart`/`_ReplayChart`). Top-bar button always shows pkt/s + unknown B/s regardless of connection state and opens the Dashboard.

### 6.8 Dead reckoning tuning screen

Minimal overview home state: a centered Dead reckoning headline, one tune line whose button morphs copy → apply when pasted over (truncating, single line), Generate new tune, and a Manual tune door into a number-grid dialog (Sensor fit / Motion / Limits, inline validation, Reset inside). No factory/tuned distinction, no paragraphs, no cards. The wizard is a left rail (Flight → Results) with live node states — numbered ring for current, filled check for done — plus one-line statuses, connected by hairlines; tapping an unlocked node jumps to it; the page scroll resets to top on every step change. The right pane shows one step inside a card: Flight (picker + Find best tune + progress + Close), Results (current → new rows for average miss and vertical error, legend + 3D preview carousel with settle ring, Apply/Discard with no Back — Discard exits to the overview). The rail stays vertically centered while the step content scrolls. Synthetic outages are fully automatic (period = duration/6 clamped 15–60 s, 5/15/45 s short/medium/long tiers cycling over the grid with fallback to shorter tiers, per-phase top-up at 15 s, one 45 s window in the longest scorable phase when the flight fits it, cap 12; unknown phases kept when no frames exist). Tuning scores the duration-weighted rotation-invariant mean (15 s weighs 1, 5 s weighs 3, 45 s weighs 1/3), so longs cannot outvote shorts. Preview labels carry the window length (`+1:23 · Parachute · 45s`) and previews run with the same terrain as tuning. Grounded phases are out of the scoring world entirely: only Ascent/Apogee/Parachute masks score. Preview language: flown input solid blue, new guess solid purple, actual continuation solid pink, no ground drop lines, 10 s lead-in, cutout dot at the cutout. Transition-spanning outages are previewed but excluded from the tuning objective; on `crc26_cleanedup_trim.bin` the automatic masks score ~1 m mean on the within-phase windows. No status pills, giant scores, icon-buttons, compass, sliders, mode toggles or dropdown paging. The estimator integrates velocity trapezoidally (exact for ramps; old backward Euler overshot every accel phase) and optionally follows a least-squares acceleration trend (800 ms window, ±25 m/s² clamp, 4 s trust budget, horizontal only, off when drag is set; default on). Vertical is regime-aware: fix-to-fix GPS altitude rates teach online climb/descent scales (the reference flight's variometer reads 1.2× on ascent but 0.3× under canopy), unsteady spans (opening shock, ringing) are rejected from learning via a spread guard, and descending with a learned rate holds toward the terminal rate instead of gravity-plunging (measured −80 m → ±5 m on 10 s parachute outages of `crc26_cleanedup_trim.bin`); ascent without canopy evidence keeps the exact-kinematics gravity arc, so a predicted apogee crossing settles onto the learned rate — mid-outage state changes are predicted from pre-outage data only, never leaked from in-outage truth. Every `DeadReckoningPosition` carries a `regime` label (`climb`/`descent`/`level`/`landed`) for previews. Live estimator follows terrain shape: `TelemetryStore` keeps tile→elevation for visited tiles (`elevationTileCenter`) and pushes them via `setTerrainSamples`; the package looks the floor up at the predicted position (nearest sample < 15 km, `max()` merge). `flutter analyze` clean, **348 green root + 50 green package = 398 total**.

### 6.9 Replay timeline events

`FlightEventType` carries label + matching `from`/`to` states + `transitionLabel`. Detection in `core/flight_events.dart`. Icon + palette color in `ui/components/flight_event_style.dart` + shared `FlightEventDot`. Events: launch, apogee, parachute, touchdown. Dots dim until playhead reaches them; tapping seeks. Markers that would overlap spread into lanes (`placeFlightEvents`, greedy, 16 px targets). Slider theme pinned (4 px track, r10 thumb, r24 overlay — M3 defaults), fixing thumb travel to 24..width-24.

## Part 7 — Replay & Recordings

### 7.1 Replay

`replayProvider.play(path)`: parses (valid header required), stores header site. Whole flight pre-decoded once for fixed chart axes. 50 ms ticker × speed (MAX = dump). `seek()` is binary search + forward-delta bulk ingest (`TelemetryStore.ingestPackets`, one state rebuild). Auto-pauses at end unless `loopEnabled` (repeat toggle in the playback bar) wraps to the start carrying the overshoot. Space toggles pause/play via an `AppShell`-level `CallbackShortcuts` binding (focused buttons/switches win via `ActivateIntent`; text input guarded). No dead reckoning during replay.

Display smoothing (replay-only, toggle in playback bar, default on): 3D trail uses centered ±25-packet moving average; attitude from averaged specific-force vector. File, charts, map stay raw. `buildReplayScene` over full pre-decoded frames (smooth-then-decimate with ±25 lookahead). Pinned by `display_smoothing_test.dart` + `replay_seek_test.dart`.

### 7.2 Recordings screen

Stat-first scan (108-byte header) + per-card concurrent preview decode (session cache by path+size+mtime). Video-style cards: whole 200 px preview is the tap target, pink center play button, primary border while loaded, header `…` menu for trim/extract-site/delete, extent 284. `TrimChart` renders `FlightEventDot`s on the altitude curve (x from flight-clock fraction, y from nearest decimated profile value, downward de-collision, dimming for cut markers).

### 7.3 Factory workspaces

- **Flight**: default live view — highlights, FSM, charts, map, 3D, channel health.
- **Prep**: pre-flight check — channel health prominent.
- **Recovery**: live dead reckoning tile.
- **Replay**: no control panel / dead reckoning.

### 2026-09 (initial sessions)

- Structure refactor: de-versioned wire (52 B) + header (108 B). Dropped legacy decoders, migrations, converter. Extracted shared UI. `widget→tile` rename.
- UI/UX pass: dropped pressure; fixed dark-mode leaks; immersive map/3D; responsive shedding.
- Overflow pass: bounded `CenteredValue`; dropped battery/hall pills; topbar regrouped + REPLAY badge.
- Topbar rethink: rescan folded into port dropdown, Reset moved to menu, fixed-width skeleton, replay slider single Expanded. Channel screen rewritten in plain language.
- AXTree spam fix: `ExcludeSemantics` on display-only live readouts; `Semantics(container:true)` per bare tooltip anchor (flutter/flutter#182444). Replay filename badge hoisted behind path-only watch.
- Launch-site flow redo (saved-only): store normalizes on load, "Use without saving" removed. Fixed settings dropdown assertion crash. Port-switcher overflow fixed.
- Channel screen: TOTAL series dropped; FSM debug states always render (arithmetic fit check). BrandMark uses `assets/icon.png`; de-consted TopBar wrappers.
- Sites dialog redo: saved list, Add on top. Sites removed from settings. `tileCacheCoverage` probes exact precache URL set.
- Mandatory launch site: `select()` non-nullable; `LaunchSiteButton` in topbar; Record disabled without site.
- Linux tray fix: per-call guards; `setTitle` on Linux; `popUpContextMenu` skipped; icon resolves to absolute path.
- Real flight converted: `Documents/TryCatch/recordings/flightlog_tcrc.bin` (26,214 packets, ~17.5 min, LKMK 2026-07-10, Prague pad, MSL 403 m).
- Replay display smoothing + seek performance: binary search + bulk ingest `seek()`; 50 ms ticker batches. **182 green.**
- Replay 3D follow-up: shared smoothing for rocket + trail (`buildReplayScene`); launch-pad camera; play/pause via `ReplayController.toggle()`. **182 green.**
- 2D map performance: skeleton no longer subscribes to telemetry; leaf consumers on narrow version selector; `ref.listen` for follow; stride-decimation ≤1500 GPS pts; O(history+dr) DR segments; `TileDisplay.instantaneous()`. **247 green.**
- 2D map white-flash + crop cache: per-layer background colors; 128-entry LRU `CroppedTileCache`. **262 green.**
- Replay timeline event markers: clickable milestone dots, pure `core/flight_events.dart`, `replayFlightEventsProvider`, `placeFlightEvents` lane algorithm, slider theme pinned.
- `FlightEventType` data-driven; `events` tile: newest-first log, live ages, replay tap-to-seek.
- Recorded-flight card redesign + trim event markers: video-style cards; `TrimChart` with `FlightEventDot`s.
- Satellite 3D depth + perspective + performance fixes: far-to-near traversal, clip-space sub-tessellation, indexed drawing, culling, static scratch buffers. **262 green.**
- Replay loop + Space transport: `ReplayState.loopEnabled` + `setLooping()` (survives reload, resets on stop), end-of-flight wraps via `_restartLoop` with overshoot carry; repeat toggle in playback bar; Space pause/play in `AppShell` (`CallbackShortcuts`, text-input guarded, inner `ActivateIntent` wins); transport tooltips advertise Space. Tests: loop persistence/reset (`replay_seek_test`), loop button + Space tooltip (`flight_events_test`). **347 green.**
- Toolchain upgrade: Flutter 3.47.2 → 3.47.4 (Dart 3.13.2 → 3.13.3). `flutter pub upgrade`: archive 4.2.0→4.3.0, code_assets 2.0.0→2.1.0, image 4.9.2→4.10.1 (all transitive; every direct dep already at latest resolvable). CI `FLUTTER_VERSION` pins (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`) bumped to 3.47.4. `flutter analyze` clean, **347 green.**
- 3D renderer cleanup + optimization (no engine switch — see Part 9): shared `resolveFlightScene`/`resolveDisplayAttitude` in `flight_scene_builder.dart` (dedupes live-vs-replay + attitude logic across all 3 tiles); trail + ground grid batched to ~3 draw calls via shared `clipWorldSegment`/`appendWorldSegment`; rocket mesh single fill pass (dropped the same-color 0.6 px stroke overdraw, reused Paint/Path); satellite drape: hillshade quantized to 1/128 (color-cache hits), generic sub-pixel tier cull for mid + pad (`_tierQuadPixels`, `_subPixelCullPx`), DEM-null fast path reuses the scene (no per-frame resampling), mesh sync extracted to `_syncMeshes`. Pixels unchanged (render-test stability metrics identical). `flutter analyze` clean, **347 green.**
- Trail wobble fix: `capTrailPoints` was tip-anchored and re-phased the whole trail past the 400 cap — measured 99.4% of displayed points jumping every growth step. Rewrote start-anchored with power-of-two stride (appends only append/thin, surviving points never move; proven zero teleports outside the fresh tail). New regression test `growing flights never move displayed points (no crawl)`. The mid-tier sub-pixel cull added in the previous pass was reverted (anchor-distance approximation is weakest exactly where it would trigger; mid is only ~9k verts) — pad cull unchanged. `flutter analyze` clean, **348 green.**
- Ground revert (user report: ground looked worse): restored the original ground rendering everywhere — plain-tile grid back to per-line `drawWorldSegment`, satellite drape back to exact (unquantized) hillshade, original inline pad-tier cull, original per-frame DEM clamp path (removed the DEM-null fast path). Then, per explicit follow-up, removed every remaining ground-tile change: `flight_3d_satellite_tile.dart` is back to zero diff (original scene block + inline mesh sync, `_syncMeshes` deleted). Kept, per user confirmation that the trail is good: the `capTrailPoints` growth-stability fix + its regression test, the batched trail path, the single-pass rocket mesh, and the behavior-identical `resolveFlightScene`/`resolveDisplayAttitude` refactors in the non-satellite tiles. `flutter analyze` clean, **348 green.**
- Dead reckoning extraction (`agent/core/dead-reckoning-package`): new pure-Dart `packages/dead_reckoning/` owning estimator + `DeadReckoningPosition`/`DeadReckoningSample`/`DeadReckoningTune` + gap scoring (`detectDeadReckoningGaps`, `syntheticDeadReckoningGaps`, `evaluateDeadReckoning`) + `geo` (moved from `lib/core/`). No "DR" abbreviation anywhere: `DrPosition`→`DeadReckoningPosition`, `drSegments`→`deadReckoningSegments`, `drStaleMs`→`deadReckoningStaleMs`, `rocketIsDr`→`rocketIsDeadReckoning`, `paintDropLineAndDr`→`paintDropLineAndDeadReckoning`. App maps frames via `lib/core/dead_reckoning_adapter.dart`; store applies tunes via `setDeadReckoningTune()` (in-memory; lab UI + persistence are a follow-up). Behavior-preserving by default (tune defaults = historical constants) plus one hardening: estimator clock never rewinds on out-of-order samples. Tests: root `dead_reckoning_test.dart` (17) replaced by package `dead_reckoning_test.dart` (27: ported estimator/geo + tune JSON/compact + drag/clamp/horizon + eval). `flutter analyze` clean, **331 green root + 27 green package = 358 total**.
- Rotation-invariant tuning (same branch): every real recording carries wind from one arbitrary direction, which must not leak into the tune. `rotatedDeadReckoningSamples()` rotates positions + horizontal velocities about the first fix (time/altitude/fix flags untouched, so time-based masks apply unchanged); `evaluateDeadReckoningRotationInvariant()` replays 8 evenly spaced headings (default, every 45°) and reports the mean of per-heading means plus worst-heading mean and heading spread. Headline tuning objective is the cross-heading mean. 5 new package tests (identity/quarter/full turn, steady leg near-zero on all headings, single-heading == plain eval). `flutter analyze` clean, **331 green root + 32 green package = 363 total**.
- Tuning lab UI (same branch): `MonitorScreen` is now two tabs (Channel health | Dead reckoning); router label `Channel health`→`Monitor`. New `DeadReckoningLabTab` (recording picker, real/synthetic outage config, 1/4/8 headings, draft-tune sliders incl. nullable clamps/horizon, defaults-vs-draft results, `DEADRECKONING1.*` copy/paste share card) + `deadReckoningTuneProvider` (persisted `trycatch.dead_reckoning_tune`, applied live via `TelemetryStore.setDeadReckoningTune()`). Measured on the real recordings before building: `crc26.bin` (4,088 frames) and `crc26_full.bin` (26,214 frames) both carry **zero real GPS gaps**, so the lab falls back to synthetic outages with a note; 8-heading eval costs 29 ms / 126 ms (synchronous, no isolate). Synthetic masks now skip the t=0 window (never scorable). Tests: `dead_reckoning_tune_store_test` (6: defaults, persist+apply, reload, corrupt, parse, reset) + `dead_reckoning_lab_tab_test` (4 widget tests via injected samples). `flutter analyze` clean, **341 green root + 32 green package = 373 total**.
- Lab promoted to its own screen (same branch, user feedback: tab was hard to find, flow unclear): new `AppScreen.deadReckoning` (`Dead reckoning`, hamburger menu, `IndexedStack` slot); `MonitorScreen` back to channel health only. Lab reworked into 5 numbered steps with plain-language helpers, a full-width Score button, and two paired-bar charts (miss by heading over 8 compass points, miss by outage oldest-first) plus a win/lose/tie verdict. Fixed an empty-debug-samples crash (`.first` on `[]`). `flutter analyze` clean, **341 green root + 32 green package = 373 total**.
- Lab simplified again (same branch, still too wide/unclear): narrow centred 640 column in the Settings voice; flight+outages merged into one card; limits behind a switch; results lead with a verdict `StatusPill` + big `CenteredValue` draft mean miss, then dot-status rows and compact charts (8-column vertical heading strip with value tooltips, paired outage bars capped at 8). `flutter analyze` clean, **341 green root + 32 green package = 373 total**.
- Optimize-first rework (same branch): the lab is now flight → optimize → performance → share. Package gains `optimize.dart`: coordinate descent over drag/smoothing/tolerance/clamps/horizon (never gravity — fixed physics), ties keep the incumbent, single upfront rotation reused across candidates, yields between candidates for progress + cancel. Plus `predictDeadReckoningTrack()` (per-sample predictions inside masks) feeding a top-down `DeadReckoningTrackPreview` (blue truth, pink guesses, no tiles). Gravity slider removed from the UI (static fixed row). Tune card is now optional fine-tuning; Optimize adopts the winner and auto-scores. Tests: optimizer beats defaults on a braking leg / holds defaults on a steady leg / progress+cancel / prediction-track geometry; widget test optimizes end-to-end. `flutter analyze` clean, **342 green root + 36 green package = 378 total**.
- Why the optimizer never won (same branch, measured on `crc26_cleanedup_full.bin`): the old recording had horizontal velocity pinned at 0.0 in all 26k frames — zero signal, no dial can fix that. On the fixed file, velocity bearing matches the GPS track within 0.1° but speed reads 20–35% low: per-rocket IMU scale error. New `DeadReckoningTune.velocityScale` (default 1.0, horizontal only, swept first at 0.8–1.4) + estimator applies it to adoption and live integration. Optimizer now finds scale 1.1 + tolerance 5.0: **3.56 m → 3.35 m** mean miss. Page shortened too: tune sliders deleted, individual params live in a Manual tune dialog (number grid with explanations + validation); Optimize card has reload-active + Manual tune buttons. `flutter analyze` clean, **347 green root + 37 green package = 384 total**.
- Guided re-tune dialog + terrain-shaped clamp (same branch): landing page is now just current tune + share string + Re-tune/Manual-tune doors. `RetuneDialog` runs flight → results: step 1 picks a recording + outage shape and searches (terrain tiles along the track queried best-effort into every estimator); step 2 shows current vs new as two big 0–100 match scores, per-phase rows (Ascent/Apogee/Parachute/Landed/Pad from frame FSM), and a drag-to-rotate 3D outage preview (pre-cutout solid blue, estimate solid pink, real dashed blue, outage window only) with stepper — then Apply/Cancel. Package: `terrain.dart` + spatial floor lookup (< 15 km, `max()` merge, threaded through eval/optimize/predict); `scoreDeadReckoningByScenario`; `deadReckoningMatchScore`. Live store feeds visited-tile elevations as spatial samples. `flutter analyze` clean, **346 green root + 41 green package = 387 total**.
- Re-tune honesty + preview polish (same branch, from screenshot review): the win pill compared raw floats while showing rounded integers (60 vs 60 reading NEW TUNE WINS) — it now compares the displayed integers, and an unchanged tune reports Already optimal instead. Step 2 reordered (scores → preview → phases) with tighter spacing and one merged caption line. The 3D preview gained a ground grid plus an N/E/up compass overlay that follows rotation. Verified the trim file still optimizes (10.9 → 9.7 m via scale 1.1 — a real but sub-integer win, now honestly a Tie). `flutter analyze` clean, **346 green root + 41 green package = 387 total**.
- Vertical regime rework + lab de-badging (user: prediction not good, UI unintuitive/AI-ish): benchmarked `crc26_cleanedup_trim.bin` (4,138 frames, 100% fixes, mostly parachute) and found the vertical channel 3× off — reported `velocityDown` ≈ 11.5 m/s vs GPS+baro altitude rate ≈ 3.8 m/s (horizontal matched, so not a global scale). Root causes: gravity arc applied to terminal descent (plunged −80 m per 10 s outage, then froze on the ground clamp) and no vertical calibration knob. Fix is estimator-only, no tune format change: fix-to-fix GPS altitude rates teach online climb/descent scales (ascent 1.2×, canopy 0.3× on the reference flight); descending with a learned rate holds toward the terminal rate, ascent without canopy evidence keeps the gravity arc, so predicted apogee crossings settle onto the learned rate (mid-outage state changes predicted from pre-outage data only). Positions carry a `regime` label for previews. Measured: 10 s masks 10.9 → 3.2 m mean (score 69.6 → 88.5), 30 s masks 71.3 → 3.6 m (26.0 → 87.5), vertical RMSE 63.5 → 3.3 m. Lab keeps its flow but drops all pills/giant scores/icon-buttons: verdict sentence, plain current → new rows (average miss + vertical error), outage dropdown, transition-span notes, descent-settle ring in the 3D preview, Manual dialog grouped Sensor fit / Motion / Limits. Tests: 4 new package tests (terminal hold, variometer calibration, apogee settle, regime labels); lab widget tests updated to new wording. `flutter analyze` clean, **347 green root + 49 green package = 396 total** (root −1 vs §2.1's 348 is the earlier `eee075e` benchmark-file removal, pre-existing).
- Lab rewrite from scratch (user: drop the compass, cover ascent/apogee, redo the confusing UI): corner E/U/N compass deleted from the outage preview; synthetic outages topped up per flown phase so `crc26_cleanedup_trim.bin` scores Ascent, Apogee, Parachute ×2, Landed with defaults; transition-spanning outages previewed but excluded from the tuning objective (unwinnable by construction — tuning on them games the freeze); the page is now three AppCards with no dialogs (Flight → Results → Tune, Settings-card grammar: what-this-is line, content, status line, one primary action), manual numbers inline with an applied-confirmation state. Estimator: unsteady-span guard rejects opening shock/ringing from vertical learning (pinned by test). Transition masks stay visibly hard (apogee→chute ~100 m — sensor garbage + unknown chute timing, shown labeled, not hidden). Widget tests rewritten (5: page shape, search+apply, discard, manual reject/save) with a two-direction page-scroll helper (every TextField hosts an inner scrollable; ListView lazily unbuilds). `flutter analyze` clean, **348 green root + 50 green package = 398 total**.
- Iteration fixes (user: too long, two previews, numbers on home, weird buttons): removed a duplicated `_OutagePreview3d` (the carousel edit had left the old view below the caption — also half the review height); manual numbers moved from the overview into a `_ManualTuneDialog` (same sections/validation/keys), overview keeps doors only; Flight Back → Close (it exits the wizard), applied Dismiss → Clear; frameless flights keep all masks (landed filter only applies with frame phases); carousel items shortened with the outage label on its own line. Tests (8 lab) updated to dialog flows. `flutter analyze` clean, **350 green root + 50 green package = 400 total**.
- Slim wizard + preview language + monitor deletion (user: no outages screen; fix tall/weird review; share dialog; settings cards; drop monitor screen): Outages step merged into Flight (select → confirm/run → review; 2-node rail), all outage configuration deleted with it (stale machinery went too — nothing left to change under a run); preview speaks in tracks only (no ground drop lines, 10 s lead-in, cutout dot at the cutout) with a legend (Flown solid blue, New guess solid purple, Actual dashed blue, Current dashed grey when changed) and a chevron+dot carousel instead of the dropdown (swipe stays with rotate); previous tune's guess drawn from the same masks; share/import moved to a dialog; overview and wizard bodies back in `AppCard`s. Monitor screen deleted (`monitor_screen.dart`, router entry, shell slot; link button → Dashboard with updated tooltip; `ChannelHealthMonitor` + exclusive widgets removed from the tile file, `_windowMs` hoisted to `_RateChart`); tile untouched. Tests (8 lab: overview, flow, landed exclusion, old-tune viz + carousel paging on an under-reading flight, discard, share load path, manual ×2). `flutter analyze` clean, **350 green root + 50 green package = 400 total**.
- Iteration fixes 3 (user: solid actual, drop old tune + facts, honest numbers, minimal home): actual continuation now solid pink (was dashed blue, invisible against the input) with matching legend; previous-tune track deleted (model, pass, paint, legend); fixed a real units bug the confusion exposed — headline scores (0–100) were displayed as metres and the verdict subtracted backwards, now mean metres throughout with phase rows deleted; flight facts line deleted; overview is a centered Dead reckoning headline + share string with copy + paste-and-load inline (share dialog deleted) + Generate/Manual doors, no factory/tuned distinction, no paragraphs; Flight Back → Close, Results Back removed with Discard exiting to overview; scroll resets to top on every step change. `flutter analyze` clean, **350 green root + 50 green package = 400 total**.
- Iteration fixes 4 (user: morphing tune line, centered rail, no coverage text, lean results, solid actual, split files): overview is one tune line whose button morphs copy → apply on paste (truncating, no linebreaks) under a Copy / Paste tune label; wizard rail vertically centered with independently scrolling content (LayoutBuilder-bounded row); coverage line and flight facts deleted; results show only comparison rows + legend + preview + buttons (verdict sentences, subtitle, ring caption, transition note, phase rows deleted); actual track and legend swatch now solid pink; previous-tune track deleted; lab split into `dead_reckoning_lab_tab.dart` + `dead_reckoning_lab_preview.dart` + `dead_reckoning_manual_dialog.dart` (recordings-screen precedent). `flutter analyze` clean, **350 green root + 50 green package = 400 total**.
- Iteration fixes 5 (user: morphing line, centered rail/cards, no coverage text, lean results, solid actual, split files): overview is one tune line under Copy / Paste tune whose button morphs copy → apply on paste (truncating single line), Generate + Manual doors, no factory/tuned text, no cards; wizard rail vertically centered with independently scrolling content, step cards horizontally centered, rail node circles vertically centered with side padding; coverage line and flight facts deleted; results show only comparison rows + legend + preview + buttons; actual track and legend swatch solid pink (previous dashed was a leftover); previous-tune track deleted; transition notes deleted (unscored outages never preview); lab split into tab + preview + manual-dialog files. `flutter analyze` clean, **350 green root + 50 green package = 400 total**.
- Multi-length outages + weighted tuning (user: keep Dart, tweak precision, preview longer/shorter): masks cycle 5/15/45 s tiers over the period grid (longs fall back to 15/5 s when they'd swallow the next slot or overrun the flight; 15 s phase top-up; one 45 s window in the longest scorable phase when the flight ≥120 s fits it); tuning objective is the duration-weighted rotation-invariant mean (`deadReckoningGapWeight`: 15 s weighs 1, 5 s weighs 3, 45 s weighs 1/3) with weighted vertical RMSE in the comparison rows; optimizer sweeps velocityScale in 0.05 steps incl. 1.25/1.4 plus an accelerationTracking on/off sweep; preview labels carry the window length and previews run with the same terrain as tuning.
- Overview + zero-knob lab (user: state-first home, always synthetic, drop Landed): page opens on the current tune + manual form + Generate new tune; wizard rail is Flight → Outages → Results (Tune node deleted); all outage settings deleted (segmented control, three sliders, real-gap mode, fallback note, `_FieldSlider`, stale machinery) — one adaptive synthetic scheme (period = duration/6 clamped 15–60 s, 10 s windows, phase top-up, cap 12); Landed/Idle/Armed/Unknown excluded from uniform masks, top-ups, facts and phase rows (`_scorablePhase`); applying returns home with an applied confirmation; scenario rows skip Landed defensively. Measured on `crc26_cleanedup_trim.bin`: 7 automatic masks, within-phase mean ~1 m. Tests rewritten (6: overview, guided flow, landed exclusion via mixed-phase debug flight, discard, manual ×2). `flutter analyze` clean, **348 green root + 50 green package = 398 total**.
- Stepper rebuild (user: long page tried and disliked — make it visual, state-reflecting, hierarchical): the page is now a left step rail (Flight → Outages → Results → Tune) with live node states (numbered ring current, filled check done, warning stale, faint locked/upcoming) plus one-line statuses, hairline connectors, tap-to-jump on unlocked steps; the right pane shows one step with headline + Back/Continue flow. Running auto-advances to Results, applying lands on Tune; config-signature stale detection disables Apply (replaced by Run again) with rail + body warnings; loading a new flight clears results; vertical errors now scored on within-phase masks only. Tests caught a real 4.5 px dropdown overflow (fixed by shortening items + label line below) and now assert rail mirroring (6 tests: rail states, guided flow, stale gate, discard, manual ×2). `flutter analyze` clean, **348 green root + 50 green package = 398 total**.

## Part 9 — Design Decisions

- Wire format is a placeholder; CRC keeps it honest. Single format, no versioning — when real firmware lands, replace the layout wholesale.
- Tiling only: everything fits the viewport, no page scroll, no holes.
- Charts show raw data, one shared code path. Modular/data-driven tiles.
- Debug builds are janky — evaluate with `flutter run -d <os> --release`.
- **Do not start the app yourself.** Ask the user for screenshots/descriptions.
- FS-backed screen widget tests are impossible: `initState` always runs in the fake-async zone where `path_provider` + `Directory.list` stall permanently.
- AXTree quirk: on mass tree churn (e.g. RESET), the Windows accessibility bridge can spam even with `ExcludeSemantics`. Suspect hover+rebuild overlay dynamics or teardown races; check whether Narrator/a screen reader is running.
